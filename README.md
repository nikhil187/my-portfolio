- **Search and Filter**: Easily find classmates by searching through names, favorite colors, or favorite foods.
- **Table View**: View all profiles in a sortable table format for better organization.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
- **gh-pages**: For deploying the application to GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## Use of Generative AI

In the development of **My Classmates**, I utilized Generative AI to assist in generating code snippets and components, which significantly accelerated the development process. Here’s how I used it:

### How I Used Generative AI
## Use of Generative AI

In the development of **Student Connect**, I utilized Generative AI to enhance my coding process. Here’s a detailed overview of how I integrated AI into my workflow:

### How I Used Generative AI
- I provided basic code snippets and concepts to the AI, which served as a foundation for the application. 
- Through iterative refining prompts, I guided the AI to generate more structured and error-free code. This collaborative approach allowed me to leverage AI's capabilities while ensuring that the final output met my project requirements.

### AI-Generated vs. My Own Code
- **AI-Generated Code**: 
  - The initial structure and functionality of various components, such as `App.js`, `ClassmateCard.js`, `ClassmatesList.js`, and `ProfileTable.js`, were with the assistance of AI to get a structured code. 
  - The AI also helped in creating the layout and styling using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive design.
  - Implemented Basic Local Storage for storing profiles.
- **My Own Code**:
  - I implemented the **search functionality**, allowing users to filter classmates based on names, favorite colors, or favorite foods.
  - I developed the **delete option**, enabling users to remove classmates from the directory, which involved managing state updates and user confirmations.

This combination of my foundational code and AI assistance resulted in a well-structured, functional, and user-friendly application.
